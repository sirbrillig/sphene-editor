# sphene-editor
A WordPress page builder plugin

This plugin adds a front-end block-based page-builder to WordPress. Each block is a custom post type.

A page built using the Sphene editor will be constructed by adding and modifying a collection of blocks. The rendered markup of each block will then be merged into a finished page.

__This plugin is an experiment and is heavily under construction.__
